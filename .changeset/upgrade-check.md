The TypeScript pack checks the migrated consumer against the release it moves to, as the Python and Go packs do. Given `upgraded`, where the new release resolves from, it type-checks the consumer's files as they were against the release used today and as the edits left them against the new one, and shows a person each error the upgrade brought, with the checker's own words and the whole statement it is in: a field the new API version no longer sends, a parameter a method stopped taking, a fixture that no longer fits the type it claims. JavaScript is checked the same way, as `checkJs` would, and only what is new is reported. `originalOffset`, which places an error in the edited text back where it was read, moves to `@invariant-app/migrate-core` for every pack, and is still exported from `@invariant-app/migrate-py`.
