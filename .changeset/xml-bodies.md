XML bodies are served. Amazon's CloudFront and CloudSearch declare every body as `text/xml`, and every Change to them was left unexplained because nothing read XML. The contract now reads an operation's XML body where it has no JSON one, so the proposer drafts for it and the prediction checks it as it does JSON; the compiler describes each XML body a site has work for, from the schema's OpenAPI `xml` object (element or attribute, wrapped or not, names, namespaces and what each place holds), as a site's `xml` program, a new program feature that asks for the next runtime; and the TypeScript runtime, the Node binding and the Go engine with its net/http middleware decode such a body into a tree, run the same instructions and write it back. Only the places the program names are decoded: every other element, and everything between elements, is written back exactly as it came, so a document nothing changed comes out byte for byte. The parser is written for hostile input: a document type declaration is refused, so no entity is expanded and nothing external is read, and nesting and namespace declarations are capped. What cannot be written back exactly is refused rather than guessed at: text among an object's elements, attributes on a value, an encoding other than UTF-8, and, at compile time, a map, a schema that contains itself, or a value read whose schema says nothing of it, which the release gate blocks. The proposer also no longer asks a vocabulary decision where a case codec already serves the field, as Adyen's `Active` becoming `active`.
