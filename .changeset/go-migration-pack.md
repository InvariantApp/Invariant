A migration language pack for Go. A small helper built on `go/packages` and `go/types` finds every reference to an SDK by the object it resolves to, reads fields by the wire name their `json` tag gives them, and reads the API operations go-github's methods say they call. The pack moves imports to the SDK's new major version, rewrites what a Change or the SDK itself renamed exactly, and type-checks the result against the new release with go.mod moved in a copy. Whatever still does not compile is shown to a person together with everything it reaches: where a value a call no longer takes was made, and the consumer's own wrappers, interfaces, other implementations and callers that pass it on, including through a method the SDK replaced with one that calls the same operation. The go toolchain runs with `GOTOOLCHAIN=local`, `-mod=readonly`, no cgo and modules only through the proxy, and the consumer's code, tests and generators are never run.

`@invariant-app/migrate-core` gains `Offsets`, which converts between the UTF-8 byte offsets a compiler reports and the string offsets an edit applies at.
