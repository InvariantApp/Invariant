/**
 * A compiled program's digest, computed here so the runtime can check the

 * SHA-256 over the program's canonical JSON (keys sorted at every level, no
 * whitespace), without `compiledBy`, which names the CLI that built it and
 * not what the program does.
 *
 * SHA-256 is written out rather than imported: the request path may import
 * nothing but exact decimal arithmetic (isolation.test.ts), and `crypto.subtle`
 * is asynchronous where loading a program is not. It runs once, at load, and
 * only when a digest is given to check.
