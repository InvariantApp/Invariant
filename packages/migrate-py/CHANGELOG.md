# @invariant-app/migrate-py

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- c6d1cac: A fixture nothing types is read as the schema it says it is. Stripe tags every object it sends with its type, `"object": "invoice"`, and a recorded webhook or a test's stand-in copies the tag with everything else; given `tags` in the symbol map, every pack now shows a person each entry of such a literal that a Change removed or moved from its schema, and each event recorded at the API version the consumer's SDK spoke before the upgrade (its `api_version`), which the upgrade moves; one recorded long before was left behind already, and is not shown. The literal is read the same way in every language, as JSON in a Go raw string, a Python dictionary or a TypeScript object, and is never rewritten: what a fixture should hold instead is the API's answer, not an edit of the old one. `taggedObjectSites` and `goneFields` are exported from `@invariant-app/migrate-core` for a pack of its own.

### Patch Changes

- 1ba578b: The TypeScript pack checks the migrated consumer against the release it moves to, as the Python and Go packs do. Given `upgraded`, where the new release resolves from, it type-checks the consumer's files as they were against the release used today and as the edits left them against the new one, and shows a person each error the upgrade brought, with the checker's own words and the whole statement it is in: a field the new API version no longer sends, a parameter a method stopped taking, a fixture that no longer fits the type it claims. JavaScript is checked the same way, as `checkJs` would, and only what is new is reported. `checkFor` bounds the check in time where the type checker offers to stop, and `checker` runs each check where the caller can stop it outright, such as in a worker it ends at the deadline; a file the check did not reach is listed in the result's `unchecked` rather than holding the migration, and `trace` is told each step as it finishes. The engine itself still starts no process and no thread. `originalOffset`, which places an error in the edited text back where it was read, moves to `@invariant-app/migrate-core` for every pack, and is still exported from `@invariant-app/migrate-py`.
  
  A field a Change moved or removed is also shown where only its name says it may be the contract's: a key of an object literal nothing types, as a test's stand-in for a subscription handed to a mock, or a read or subscript of a value typed `any`, as a webhook's payload. Such a place is never rewritten, as the Python pack does with a dictionary's keys; a use typed as anything else is the checker's to decide.

### Minor Changes

- 7aa6dbe: Python consumers can be migrated. `@invariant-app/migrate-py` reads a Python repository against the SDK release it uses today, through pyright for what each name refers to and tree-sitter for what the code does with it, and writes the edits the Changes determine: a renamed field wherever it is read, set, passed by keyword or written as a key the type checker ties to the SDK, and a renamed value where a field is compared with it. A removed field, a subscript or `.get()` by a field's name, a read the checker cannot type, an expansion (`expand=["latest_invoice.payment_intent"]`) through a removed field and every API version pin (`stripe.api_version`, `stripe_version=`) are reported to a person, never edited. The result is then checked against the release being moved to, and every place that stops type-checking is reported with the checker's words, whether or not a Change named it, including a `match` a newly added value leaves incomplete and the consumer's own copy of values the SDK widened.
  
  The SDK and what its metadata requires are installed from wheels only, unpacked and checked against the digest the index publishes; a release with no wheel is refused rather than built. pyright is never pointed at an interpreter, so nothing of the consumer's, and no Python at all, is run.
  
  `@invariant-app/migrate-core` holds what every language pack shares: the migration plan, byte-range edits, the sites shown to a person and how a re-encoding is described. `@invariant-app/migrate-ts` re-exports them, so nothing that imports them from there changes.
